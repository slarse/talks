# What is imposter syndrome?

## About the name

* Until a week ago I had only ever heard it called _imposter syndrome_
    - Appears to be the most popular term in social media
    - Also the name of the Wiki page
* Originally coined as _imposter phenomenon_ (IP) way back in '78 [@clance1978imposter]
    - Appears to be the most popular term in research
* A third term is _perceived fraudulence_ [@kolligian1991perceived]
    - The authors argue that the other two popular terms make it sound like a
      disease or personality disorder, which they do not believe it to be

## But what is it?

> The term impostor phenomenon is used to designate an internal experience of intellectual phoniness which appears to be particularly prevalent and intense among a select sample of high achieving women [@clance1978imposter]

\

> The imposter phenomenon refers to feelings of phoniness experienced by high achievers [@kumar2006imposters]

\

> Imposter phenomenon is defined as a self-perception of intellectual fraudulence despite achieving objective success and accomplishments [@maji2021they]

## Inward-facing symptoms

> Anxiety, self-doubt, fear of failure, and guilt about success undermine their ability to function at their highest level. [@clance1988imposter]

\

> In the face of faltering self-confidence, internalization of failures, and over focus on mistakes over the long term, stress and anxiety become constant companions. [@parkman2016imposter]

## Outward-facing symptoms

IP can have wildly different effects on different people. It can for example:

* Motivate _very hard_ work to avoid being discovered as an imposter [@clance1978imposter] [@kumar2006imposters] [@parkman2016imposter]
    - With all the lovely burnout that comes with it!
* Cause one to avoid tasks perceived as difficult or challenging, as there is a chance of failure [@kumar2006imposters]
* Cause one to express the beliefs and opinions of others as they have no faith in their own [@clance1978imposter]

## How do you get it? Is it contagious?

Clance & Imes (1978) [@clance1978imposter] suggest two paths to IP for the women they studied

1. Having a sibling designated "the clever one" by parents
    - Indoctrination from a young age to undervalue her own skills
    - Difficulty ascribing their accomplishments to themselves
2. Always being told _they_ are the clever one, and that they can do everything and anything, but then encounter difficulties in the real world
    - Her parents must have been wrong about her intellect, because things aren't easy!
    - Having to put effort into achieving something while perceiving that others do not can greatly contribute to IP [@kumar2006imposters]

## It's all about perception

Clance & Imes (1978) [@clance1978imposter] make it clear that this is all about perception

\

> Women who experience the impostor phenomenon maintain a strong belief that they are not intelligent; in fact, they are convinced that they have fooled anyone who thinks otherwise.

\

> The clinical symptoms most frequently reported are generalized anxiety, lack of self-confidence, depression, and frustration related to inability to meet **self-imposed** standards of achievement.

## Imposture as a spectrum

There is an idea of _imposture_ as a spectrum [@gediman1985imposture], and with a little bit of imagination one can interpret it like so

* At one extreme are the most pathological liars and deceivers, the _true_ imposters
* At the other extreme are those that _feel_ like imposters while in reality they are not

# My journey through university, catching some IP and coming out alive

## Starting out older

* I was 22 going on 23 years old when I started the computer science program at KTH
* My class mates were a good 4 to 5 years younger than I - practically toddlers!
* I believed that being "much older", I also had to be "much smarter"
* They had already been programming for years - so I had to catch up!

## I worked hard (not to be found out)

\large

... and performed very well

But I perceived my class mates to get by _just as well_ with _less work_


And my state of mind wasn't entirely ... stable

## A vivid memory of a crisis

\large

Just as I started the master's program I had a course in AI, with a warm-up task to implement a pathfinding algorithm.

## It was just a silly mistake

After several days I realized I'd just put an extra newline in the output such that the _very picky_ automatic grader didn't accept the solution.

## Sanity level - your resilience to ghostly intervention

* Each player has a sanity level
* Decreases when spooky stuff happens
* Lower sanity $\Rightarrow$ more spooky stuff
    - Feedback loop!
* Very low sanity $\Rightarrow$ triggers a _hunt_
    - And the ghost tries to kill you
* Great fun :)

## Resiliency to imposter syndrome

I think of IP much like sanity in Phasmophobia

Everyone is susceptible and life events lower or raise your resilience

* Has "the clever one" sibling: $-50$ resilience
* Successfully eats ice cream: $+1$ resilience
* Drops ice cream: $-5$ resilience
* Does a talk on IP and almost no one shows up: $-10$ resilience

Lower resilience $\Rightarrow$ more IP symptoms $\Rightarrow$ lowers resilience

## IP is not something you "have"

IP is not something you "have" or "don't have"

The people we say _have_ IP are at the lower extreme of resilience

\

> [...] IP is not a matter of having it or not. Rather, one can experience some or all of the aspects of IP to a greater or lesser extent. So we should think of IP as a spectrum phenomenon and recognize that many individuals fall somewhere on the spectrum. We can think of those who identify most strongly with the diagnostic statements as the paradigm instances of IPPs. [@slank2019rethinking]

\centering \tiny Note: Poorly paraphrased from memory

## Self-imposed expectations

The trainees have high, self-imposed expectations on their abilities


They are not _actually_ expected to be able to do everything out of the gate


But does _self-imposed_ mean that external factors have nothing to do with it?

## Self-imposed expectations usually originate from external factors

## IP symptoms are not necessarily irrational

There is a general notion that sufferers of IP are irrational high achievers ...

They may simply be better at acknowledging that factors outside of their control played a role in their success [@slank2019rethinking]

It is feasible that one can suffer from IP symptoms _and_ be justified in one's belief

\

> [...] we must not dismiss the serious negative behavioral and affective aspects of IP—i.e., the pain and anguish that can accompany even a justified lack of confidence in one’s talents [@slank2019rethinking]

## This shifts the problem definition

If the IP is _justified_ the original problem definition does not apply

It is no longer about the irrational high achiever, but a rational person

We're _kind of_ moving the goal posts, so we need to redefine the problem itself

## Two theories of intelligence

Carol Dweck and Mary Murphy describe intelligence as perceived in one of two ways

* Entity theory of intelligence
    - Intelligence is an innate, static trait
    - You're either born intelligent, or you're not
* Incremental theory of intelligence
    - Intelligence is a malleable trait
    - By learning new things you expand your intelligence

## The "Genius Culture" problem

A Genius Culture [@slank2019rethinking] values individual performance above all else

It subscribes to the entity theory of intelligence

The more effort you exert to accomplish something, the less intelligence you possess

Individuals will hide or downplay the amount of effort put in to achieving something

## Your weaknesses - their strengths

When you see someone who is good at something that you are not

... it's easy to compare yourself to them by that quality

But you miss so many important details!

# Summary

## Quick recap

* IP is an umbrella term for a collection of symptoms/feelings
* It is not a thing you "have" or "don't have" - it's a spectrum
* Anyone can experience IP symptoms
    - You don't need a specific level of competence to "qualify"
* IP symptoms can arguably be rational
    - And then an environment like a Genius Culture is the actual problem

## What can we do?

Here are just some thoughts

* Talk about it!
* Avoid propagating the superstar/rockstar/10Xer ideals
* Be open about the effort you put in to achieve success
    - Effort is not anathema to intelligence
